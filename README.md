# Resource Bundles Toolkit

This is an **Unofficial** implementation of [Resource Bundles](https://github.com/WICG/resource-bundles). Currently this toolkit contains:

- [@resourcebundles/format](./packages/format/README.md): Resource Bundles parser and serializer
- [@resourcebundles/cli](./packages/cli/README.md): CLI for inspecting and creating Resource Bundles
- [@resourcebundles/static-server](./packages/static-server/README.md): Server that serves static files from Resource Bundles, as documented in [Other possible uses of resource bundles](https://github.com/WICG/resource-bundles/blob/main/other-uses.md)

As the Resource Bundles is in very early stage, please do not expect compatibility between different versions of these packages.
